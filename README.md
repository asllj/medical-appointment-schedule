## Technical Challenge

In this challenge you are asked to develop a backend service to book medical appointments
for a private hospital. The users of this system are the doctors and the patients. The
appointments start from 9am to 7pm, each lasting about 1 hour.

You must cover the following use cases for the consumers of this API.

  • As a patient, I must be able to see the availability of the doctors and schedule an
  appointment for myself.
  
  • As a doctor, I must be able to see the appointments that I have for a given time
  period.
  
  • As a doctor, I can set my self as unavailable for a specific time period. blocking any
  patients from scheduling an appointment for that period. (e.g., doctor can be on
  vacation, sick, etc…)
  
The back-end can be built in one of the following languages: Java or Golang.
We expect you to cover the following aspects:
  • Easy configuration
  • Easy to run it locally (must be a containerised solution)
  • Logging
  • Testing
  • Metrics - nice to have
  • Security
  
To submit the challenge please create a public repository with a proper readme and upload
